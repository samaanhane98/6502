# CPU Project

This projects is an attempt at a CPU build for the Pynq Z2 board. The inspiration for the CPU is the 6502 processor. Much of the VHDL is based on the following repo: https://github.com/bernardo-andreeti/6502.

# ISA

Eventually, all 6502 legal instructions will be supported. Currently, the following instructions have been considered:

- [x] ADC
- - [x] IMM
- - [x] ZERO PAGE
- - [x] ZERO PAGE X
- - [x] ABS
- - [x] ABS,X
- - [x] ABS,Y
- - [x] Indirect Indexed
- - [x] Indexed Indirect

- [x] LDA
- - [x] IMM
- - [x] ZERO PAGE
- - [x] ZERO PAGE X
- - [x] ABS
- - [x] ABS,X
- - [x] ABS,Y
- - [x] Indexed Indirect
- - [x] Indirect Indexed

- [x] LDX
- - [x] IMM
- - [x] ZERO PAGE
- - [x] ABS
- - [x] ABS,Y

- [x] LDY
- - [x] IMM
- - [x] ZERO PAGE
- - [x] ZERO PAGE X
- - [x] ABS
